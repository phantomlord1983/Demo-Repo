 Woe be upon the person who reads this tombstone. This poor fool was a man named Hayes Temple. He was a poor student in the painful electrical engineering degree program at Mississippi State University. He loved video games, concerts, playing his bass, and horror movies until he was robbed of that by the institution. May peace be upon his soul and may doom befall those who read this epitaph.
